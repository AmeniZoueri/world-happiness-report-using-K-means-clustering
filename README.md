# world-happiness-report-using-K-means-clustering

In this case study, we will use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to group countries based on their economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The World Happiness Report, which determines the state of global happiness, provides the data for this study. The happiness scores and rankings were collected by asking individuals to rate their lives on a scale of 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life).
